# Be Heard

Be Heard is an example blog app using JavaScript, HTML & CSS. It functions as a platform where people who want to share their stories regarding oppression and the hardships that go in hand with it can do so.

# Our Motivation

Our team was made from peers of the 8th coding cohort from the Road to Hire program. We as a team understood the importance of bringing attention to and providing the details and statistics of how the results of all forms of oppression manifest in our society. We, as a team, also understood that for people, oppression does not always feel like numbers and graphs but instead as experiences and stories. So we set out to provide a space where these stories can be shared and people can Be Heard.

# Features
