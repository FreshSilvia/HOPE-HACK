          Racism has been examined in its many forms. Scholarship regarding how individuals personally experience, cope with, and manage racial oppression is still developing. The term “appropriated racial oppression” reframes the construct “internalized racism” as a process whereby members of a group appropriate a dominant group's ideology, adapt their behavior, and perceive a subordinate status as deserved, natural, and inevitable. The expression of appropriated racial oppression is based on a variety of complicated and interacting processes, such as incentivized societal norms, critical consciousness, and racial socialization

          Social Oppression is unfairly treating a person or group of people who are different from other people or groups of people.  A few examples of social oppression include racism (treating people different based on their ethnicity), sexism (treating people different based on their gender), religious persecution (treating people different because of their religion.) and economic oppression.

          gender oppression is an effect of the social process of gender relations that institutionalize and reproduce certain norms of gender to privilege the dominant group and marginalize, exclude, or cause other harm to the oppressed group. Through feminist concerns (including third‐wave, poststructural, and postcolonial feminisms) as well as the efforts of queer activists/theory and transgender activists/studies, gender norms are unsettled because of the extreme abuses, violence, and dehumanization suffered by those who transgress gender norms. An overview of both global and historical trends of gender theory contributes to a rethinking of the systems of gender oppression.

          Religious persecution means unfair treatment of a particular group of people because of their religion. It aims at forcing the religious to go away or give up their religion. "Persecution" comes from a Latin word meaning "chase", and usually meant chasing someone in order to kill them. In later centuries the term was applied to other actions
